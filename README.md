# Backend Developer Challenge, Curve Labs

Curve Labs, as a design and implementation laboratory, utilizes what we call component-integrative design, where we create, combine, and integrate components to form organizations that are more than the sum of their parts. This challenge is designed to test your capabilities at combining Ethereum modules in this fashion.

[Decentralized autonomous organizations](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-a-dao-c7e84aa1bd69), or DAOs for short, are blockchain-native organizations that can manage or govern a treasury or any Ethereum smart-contract. One framework we commonly work with is the DAOstack framework, whose DAO-modules are advanced enough to be used in production for clients of the Lab.

## Challenge

For the challenge, you will first be required to deploy a `CRPFactory` and use it to deploy [configurable rights pool](https://github.com/balancer-labs/configurable-rights-pool) and transfer its ownership to a DAO powered by [DAOstack‚Äôs Arc1.0](https://github.com/daostack/arc). From there, you will deploy a DAOstack [scheme](https://daostack.github.io/DAOstack-Hackers-Kit/gettingStarted/setupGenericScheme/) that the DAO can use to govern the pool you created in the first step. Also you will create a  minimal-viable-proposal UI that appears in [Alchemy](https://alchemy.daostack.io/).

For `ConfigurableRightsPool.sol`, the DAO should be able to govern the following parameters for its pool:

- `setPublicSwap(bool publicSwap)` ‚Äî DAO can pause or unpause the pool
- `setSwapFee(uint swapFee)` ‚Äî DAO can set the pool‚Äôs swap fee 
- `upDateWeight(address token, uint newWeight)` ‚Äî DAO can update the weight of a pool token individually.
- `updateWeightsGradually(uint[] newWeights, uint startBlock, uint endBlock)` ‚Äî DAO can transform all weights linearly to the new weights specified, setting the start and end blocks for the transformation. 
- `commitAddToken(address token, uint balance, uint denormalizedWeight)` ‚Äî DAO can precommit a new token to be applied addTokenTimeLockInBlocks blocks in the future.
- `applyAddToken()` ‚Äî DAO can apply the token committed in the step above, and mint pool shares.
- `removeToken(address token)` ‚Äî DAO can remove an existing token and return the balance to the controller.
- `whitelistLiquidityProvider(address provider)` ‚Äî DAO can add an address, after which this address can join the pool. 
- `removeWhitelistedLiquidityProvider(address provider)`‚Äî DAO can remove an address, after which this address can no longer join a pool. 
- `joinPool(uint poolAmountOut, uint[] maxAmountsIn)` ‚Äî DAO can add liquidity to the pool
- `exitPool(uint poolAmountIn, uint[] minAmountsOut)` ‚Äî DAO can withdraw liquidity to the pool

## Expectations and Assistance

We do not expect you to be able to do everything on your own to complete this challenge. DAOstack is a tricky DAO framework to work with, with many irritating idiosyncrasies for the developer environment. To this end, we have two developers internal to the lab who are available for providing support. We are also happy to spin up a Telegram group chat so you can ask questions in real-time to the team.

Telegram handles:

## Submission

We prepared a [folder](https://github.com/Curve-Labs/backend-challenge/tree/master/balancer-scheme) with helper functions and deployment scripts, you can use it as astarting point or check out [necDAO-uniswap scheme](https://github.com/Curve-Labs/necDAO-uniswap/) as a reference.

Fork the repo and open a new PR when ready, we will review the code and merge the PR from the successful candidate.

We don't expect the code to have the full test coverage but would like to see the functions being reasonably tested on the `Rinkeby` testnet.

## Reward

We will invite the first successful candidate to a second-round interview with our team.

- The creation of a DAOstack DAO-governed Balancer configurable rights pool scheme where parameters are governable by the DAO.

- Creation and display of a minimal-viable-proposal UI (a .json configuration, [similar to this](https://github.com/Curve-Labs/necDAO-uniswap/blob/master/deployments/rinkeby/UniswapProxy_Implementation.json)) that appears in [Alchemy](https://alchemy.daostack.io/), DAOstack‚Äôs front-end interface for DAOs [Github](https://github.com/daostack/alchemy). The UI does not have to be detailed, but it should be clear that proposals can be submitted to (1) deploy a new pool factory, (2) deploy new pools, and (3) govern the parameters of pools deployed. [Here is an example](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/scheme/0x252d4c96bc18c6e0670f5cebeda40d6997688223d9498c8a61e0cb45c2c0a3ff/) of a UI for whitelisted tokens on a DEX in Alchemy:

</p>

- Submission and execution of three proposals in a toy DAO: (1) creation of a new pool factory, (2) deployment of a new smart pool, and (3) adjusting the parameters of the deployed smart pool.


- Merger of the aforementioned into the Curve Labs repository under an open-source license.

## Bonus

The following bonuses are not required but would certainly amaze the team and designate the applicant as a stand-out candidate.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy a version of the DAO with the Balancer Pool scheme to (xDAI Chain)[https://www.xdaichain.com/].

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a DAOstack scheme where the DAO can create a factory contract `CRPFactory.sol`. For this bonus, no interface development is required. For `CRPFactory.sol`, the DAO should be able to set the following parameters when creating a new smart pool factory:

- The following boolean permissions:

	- `canPauseSwapping`
	- `canChangeSwapFee`
	- `canChangeWeights`
	- `canAddRemoveTokens`
	- `canWhitelistLPs`
	- `canChangeCap`
	- `canRemoveAllTokens`

- The following pool parameters:

	- `string tokenSymbol` - Symbol of the Balancer Pool Token representing this pool
	- `string tokenName` - Name of the Balancer Pool Token representing this pool
	- `address[] tokens` - Array of 2-8 token addresses. The pool will hold these.
	- `uint256[] startBalances` - Array of initial balances for the tokens specified above.
	- `uint256[] startWeights` - Array of initial weights for the tokens specified above.
	- `uint swapFee` - Initial swap fee for the pool (subject to min/max limits)

- And the pool factory address, `address factoryAddress`
